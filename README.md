Few step are common in for the initial stage of this algorithm i will explain it below-
1 - upload the dataset we can use panda library
2 - to select the parameter for k0 and k1 by diving the dataset with respect to it contents in my code i have parameters ko,k1 as x,y
3 - since we have words or string in our data set we need to convert them into array or number to classify it
I used the label encoder function to transform the parameters.
4 - In order to split the data we have to change it into a test and train like X_train,y_ytrain,X_test and y_test. Take test_size as 20%.
